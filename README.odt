# SuperSoldiers
A dragon is attempting to conquer Canada by sending monsters after all of its cities. The military responds by sending its elite super
soldiers powered by ancient gems to fight them.

The game is pretty straight forward. If you don't know what to do, just mash buttons and you'll make stuff happen. You play as the
Pink Super Soldier in this game, though she appears white in monocrome.
I originally thought of this as being a much longer game with many levels, but had to drastically scale back because of the space
constraints on the Arduboy. I may make sequels in order to continue to the story. I haven't even gotten to the giant robots yet.

If there is anything you don't like in this game, feel free to modify the code and make it better. Asking me to do it for you
is unlikely to get any results. I'm gonna be spending some time playing other peoples' games after this before I consider
getting back into coding.

Have fun!
